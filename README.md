Amazon Sales Report
Overview
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Amazon sales data.
The data is stored in a CSV file, and the analysis is performed using Python with libraries like pandas and matplotlib.
The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

Repository Contents
amazon_sales_data.csv: The CSV file containing Amazon sales data.
amazon_sales_analysis.py: Python script for analyzing the sales data.

Getting Started
To run the Python script in this project, you'll need to set up your local environment with the necessary dependencies.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
numpy: For numerical operations.
You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
Running the Analysis
Open the Python Script

Open amazon_sales_analysis.py in VS Code.
Update the File Path
Ensure the path to the CSV file is correctly specified in the Python script. Update the path in the pd.read_csv function if necessary:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Update the path to where your CSV file is located
amazon_sales = pd.read_csv('path/to/amazon_sales_data.csv')

# Example analysis
print(amazon_sales.head())
Run the Python Script

You can run the script directly from VS Code. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (you can use the shortcut Ctrl+`) and execute:


python amazon_sales_analysis.py

#The Python script includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and adjusts data types as needed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides summaries and statistical insights.
Visualization: Creates visualizations to reveal trends and patterns in the sales data.
Example Analysis
Here is an example of how to load and view the data:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
amazon_sales = pd.read_csv('path/to/amazon_sales_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(amazon_sales.head())
